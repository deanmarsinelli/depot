# Unity-Demos

This repo will be my dumping ground for all Unity related demos I create. Each root directory will be for a different project/demo. Most of these are just for fun and learning, but hopefully there will be a couple of cool ones! Feel free to clone the repo and mess around with these, most of them will be following tutorials or messing around.

I'll post the finished demos at http://deanmarsinelli.com/projects

Enjoy!
