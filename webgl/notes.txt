coordinates
===================
same as OpenGL - right handed system, +Z is out of the screen, -Z is into the screen

vertex shader
===================
gl_Position = output position of the vertex (REQUIRED), vec4
gl_PointSize = size of a vertex point (not needed)


2 ways to pass data to a vertex shader: attribute variables and uniform variables

1) attribute variable: hold data that DIFFERS per vertex
    - can hold vertex position (different for every vertex)
    - e.g.      attribute      vec4   a_Position
            (storage qualifer)(type)(variable name)

2) uniform variable: hold data that is the SAME for each vertex


fragment shader
===================
gl_FragColor - final pixel color (REQUIRED), vec4
